        - Tries Real Peaceful Mode mod alone (with its dependency).
        
        - Find the smallest reproducible set of this crash - for example, if this crash occurs when you only install real_peaceful_mode, immersiveengineering and patchouli, even if you add some new mods, the smallest reproducible set is the three mods mentions above if the same crash occurs.
