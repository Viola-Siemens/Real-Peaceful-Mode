  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message5": "Obviously no, I'm just an archer protecting my king.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message6": "Well, yea, an archer without a bow.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message7": "Stop laughing at me! I was just trying to crack the crystal but broke my bow by accident. What are you here for? I'll call the security.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message8": "Chill out, archer. Listen, I come for peace. Why you want to break the glowing rock?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message9": "Have you heard about the legend about crystal skull? It is said that this rock was brought from a crystal cave in the aether.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message10": "But Aether Dragon died thousand years ago. We are not sure what the crystal cave turned into, neither do we know where the crystal skull is.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message11": "So another question, why you hold on to the crystal skull? And actually I don't know the legend.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message12": "Crystal skull is the symbol of power and glory. If you can crack the crystal and present it to the king, he must bestow supreme honor on you.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message13": "Fine. I'll take a try. But the crystal is infected, so I'm not sure the crystal skull lies inside it.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message14": "And do not play tricks, foreigner. You are inside the skeleton palace. I'm watching you.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message15": "What? There's nothing inside the crystal. I'm going to tell the king about it.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message1": "Who's that?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message2": "Sorry for entering the palace without permission, sire. But I'm supposed to tell you there's nothing inside the glowing crystal.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message3": "I heard about you, but you just cracked it already? Amazing! None of my archers made it out.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message4": "But we really need the crystal skull. Our skeleton family's prosperity is on the decline. So we need it to put us on the path to the recovery.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message5": "I don't quite understand, and I afraid that the crystal skull is still in the dimension called the aether.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message6": "Well... you know why skeletons are always attacking the players for no reasons?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message7": "No, sire.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message8": "Skeletons are cursed, powerful but weak. They have to protect themselves this way unconsciously.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message9": "But if I obtain the crystal skull, everything will change. I can charge my scepter with it, and save my people of my kingdom. That's my duty.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message11": "Thanks. Take this with you. You might need this bead in some cases.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message5": "What happens? Did I make any mistakes?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message6": "No, you did a good job. But the crystal skull has little energy left, neither does my scepter. \"Noise of the nether\" is needed to charge them.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message7": "I don't know what it is, but I can tell you the key characteristic of it. It's as soft as dirt, and can be commonly found in the nether.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message8": "When the wind blows over, it reflects noise that sounds like ghosts' yell. Most importantly, it has the ability to turn cooled lava into basalt.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message9": "Turning cooled lava into basalt? I think I know what it is.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message10": "I've got 64 soul soil blocks. Is it what you need?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message11": "Yes, nice job! That's right what I need! I'll try it.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message12": "It works! Take my scepter, my cavalier.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message13": "What? So you are giving the scepter to me?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message14": "You deserve it. You put our skeleton family on the way to the recovery, and also I don't need this anymore.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message15": "You must walk on a more harder path to your journey in this world. All monsters changes a lot after the Aether Dragon's death.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message16": "I wish the scepter will bless you when you meet troubles, and give you power to fight back. Go and save them, my cavalier.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton3.message17": "Thank you for your encouragement, sire. And I'm ready to help other creatures.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.event.skeleton_arm.message2": "I don't know. I was just sleeping nearby. As I woke up, I found my arm's missing.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper1.message16": "Finally, I successfully made this transgenic plant. It cost me a lot of flowers and gunpowder.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper1.message17": "But I'm still not quite sure how to make a explosion blocker from this. Maybe I need, a sample of spores from a stable creeper?",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper2.message15": "It doesn't matters. Follow me and I'll help you find your place.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper2.message16": "Thank you, I'm... so delighted... that I'll explode...",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper2.message17": "What? Oh, that sounds horrible. But I remember that you said you are not able to explode.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper2.message18": "Yes... So don't worry about me. I'm following you.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper2.message19": "Thank you for sending me back to the town. By the way, I think I should tell you something about myself.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper2.message24": "Sorry, I don't mean to disappoint you. I want to find a way to make creepers reproduce without exploding.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message1": "Hi, my friend! You know what, I finally successfully made this!",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message2": "You did? How does it work?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message3": "That's a transgenic medicine. After drinking this, creepers will be able to spread their spores by breathing.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message4": "And its another function is to smoothen the mood changes of creepers to avoid explosions.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message5": "Great! Let me help you send it to other towns!",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message6": "OK, please lead the way.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message15": "Yes, but...",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message16": "What's wrong? The drug doesn't work?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message17": "It works OK, and creepers won't explode anymore.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.creeper3.message18": "So... you are picked on by them?",
