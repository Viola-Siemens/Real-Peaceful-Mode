Luckily, some pioneers of us find golden apples are good medicine against the virus, but we must solve the problem from the root. We build magic pools in swamps - ",

If you want to fight for zombies against the tyrant, I believe everyone will help you eventually.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie2.message7": "Yes, he took our hearts, and our mind. I'm supposed to be the only survivor in that disaster.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie2.message8": "I've been escaping for hundreds of years. Oh my Aether Dragon God, hope they can't find and recognize me now.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie3.message5": "Why you still drag your heels in it? You make wars between zombies and other innocent creatures. Why?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie3.message6": "Wars... makes us stronger... peace is for losers...",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie3.message7": "No, peace is for winners. I defeat you, and I'll bring peace to zombies.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie3.message8": "It makes... no sense... I'll... be back soon...",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.zombie3.message9": "If so, I'll beat you another time!",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message1": "My bow's broken now. And I still can't crack the crystal. What could it be inside the rock?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message2": "Woah, a skeleton without weapon!",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message3": "Player? P... please... don't hurt me...",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message4": "No no, I swear I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me. This building is awesome. Is it your house?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message5": "Obviously no, I'm just an archer protecting my king.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message6": "Well, yea, an archer without a bow.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message7": "Stop laughing at me! I was just trying to crack the crystal but broke my bow by accident. What are you here for? I'll call the security.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message8": "Chill out, archer. Listen, I come for peace. Why you want to break the glowing rock?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message9": "Have you heard about the legend about crystal skull? It is said that this rock was brought from a crystal cave in the aether.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message10": "But Aether Dragon died thousand years ago. We are not sure what the crystal cave turned into, neither do we know where the crystal skull is.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message11": "So another question, why you hold on to the crystal skull? And actually I don't know the legend.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message12": "Crystal skull is the symbol of power and glory. If you can crack the crystal and present it to the king, he must bestow supreme honor on you.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message13": "Fine. I'll take a try. But the crystal is infected, so I'm not sure the crystal skull lies inside it.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message14": "And do not play tricks, foreigner. You are inside the skeleton palace. I'm watching you.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton1.message15": "What? There's nothing inside the crystal. I'm going to tell the king about it.",

  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message1": "Who's that?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message2": "Sorry for entering the palace without permission, sire. But I'm supposed to tell you there's nothing inside the glowing crystal.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message3": "I heard about you, but you just cracked it already? Amazing! None of my archers made it out.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message4": "But we really need the crystal skull. Our skeleton family's prosperity is on the decline. So we need it to put us on the path to the recovery.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message5": "I don't quite understand, and I afraid that the crystal skull is still in the dimension called the aether.",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message6": "Well... you know why skeletons are always attacking the players for no reasons?",
  "rpm.mission.real_peaceful_mode.skeleton2.message7": "No, sire. "
